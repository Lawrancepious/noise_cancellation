Welcome!
I'm excited to share My Noise Cancellation Assignment with you!
This project is all about creating a more pleasant audio experience by reducing background noise.
there's two Scenario
1,Single Speaker Scenario: Imagine being in a noisy coffee shop,
  but still being able to hear your friend's voice clearly.
2,Multiple Speaker Scenario: Picture a conference call with multiple participants, 
  where everyone's voice comes through loud and clear, despite the background chatter.
How Does it Work?
1,Noise Cancellation Algorithm: Our secret sauce! We use a combination of spectral subtraction 
  and noise profile updates to reduce background noise.
2,Real-Time Processing: We process audio in real-time, ensuring that the noise cancellation is applied instantly.

System Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux 
Python Version: 3.7 or later 
Required Libraries:

NumPy (for numerical wizardry)
WebRTC VAD (for speech detection)
SciPy (for signal processing)
Troubleshooting
  Error Messages: Check the console output for error messages 
  Audio Issues: Ensure your audio input and output devices are't fighting with each other 
Known Limitations:
  Limited Error Handling
  No Support for Multiple Audio Devices

Kindly Consider my Assignment.
